# Cardiac-simulation-workflow
# Notes from Daya Kern
So necessary files from these bunch of folders are:
AFNI_Conversion: has the scripts I used within the workflow
	(Scripts/, Matlab/, Gradient_Direction_Files/)
Kepler_Workflows: has the final workflow shown in the demo:
	(thesis_workflow_total.kar)
Original_Scripts: has the original scripts that I modified to suit the project

The other information (DWI data files, etc will be handled a bit differently)
